        <p>What are subprogramms and how can they be used, each subprogram is essentially GCode, you can create G Code for a specific task, e.g V Carve a heart, if the GCode to carve the heart were then saved as subprogram, you couls easily re-use the same GCode</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>In the following image the subprogram, in this case V carving a heart is used to repeat a job at 6 different work coordinates, easily reproducing a carve across multiple positions, without copying all the code for the V carve again and again.</p>

        <p>In the image above there are further codes and subprograms, subprogram O1000 sets the initial job parameters and turns on the spindle:</p>

        <p><a href="/Variables/Index">Variables</a> and custom <a href="/MCodes/Index">M Codes</a> can also be used to enhance the experience, for instance in subprogram O1000 a variable is used to set the spindle speed, this can be changed whilst the program runs by having a new variable with a different value.</p>
        <p>Custom M Codes are used in this example to pause for 1 second after the job has been repeated and M610 allows for a sound to be played on the computer which provides an audiable reference for the operator.</p>
